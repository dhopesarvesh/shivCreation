        Rangoli is a traditional Indian art form that has been practiced for centuries, adorning homes, courtyards, and temples with intricate and colorful patterns. 
        This art form is deeply embedded in Indian culture and is often associated with festivals, religious rituals, and celebrations. The word "Rangoli" is derived from the Sanskrit words "Rang" (color) and "Avali" (rows or lines), which collectively mean a row of colors.

        The practice of making Rangoli is believed to bring good luck, prosperity, and positive energy into homes and sacred spaces. The origin of Rangoli dates back to ancient Hindu scriptures and epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata, where it is mentioned as a means of welcoming gods, goddesses, and honored guests.
          It is said that Goddess Lakshmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity, is particularly pleased by beautifully designed Rangoli patterns, making it an integral part of Diwali celebrations. In addition to Diwali, Rangoli is also created during other Indian festivals such as Pongal, Onam, Holi, Navratri, and Dussehra, as well as on auspicious occasions like weddings, baby showers, and housewarming ceremonies.
